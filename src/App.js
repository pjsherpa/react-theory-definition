          <li>What is a component in react?</li>- A component is a small and
          reusable piece of code that represents a part of the user
          interface(UI). It can contain any combination of HTML,CSS and JS and
          is easily able to be inserted into a bigger webpage.
          <li>What is JSX in react</li>- Javascript Syntax extention is an
          extention that allows us to write HTML like codes directly in our JS
          files. This makes the codes simpler to read as we do not have to go
          back and forth between two files.
